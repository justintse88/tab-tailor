# Tab Tailor

Tab Tailor is a web application that allows you to customize the tab title and favicon using an emoji picker and an input field.

## Purpose

This project exists because I always have multiple browser windows opened, each with its own purpose. With the taskbar hidden, I need to scan the tabs to know which window I'm in. With this project, I can keep this site opened in each window as the leftmost tab, and I can easily tell which window I'm in.

## Features

- Select an emoji to set as the favicon.
- Enter a custom title for the tab.
- Update the tab title and favicon using URL parameters.

## Usage

### 1. Manual Input

- Click on the emoji display to open the emoji picker.
- Select an emoji.
- Enter a new title in the input field.
- The tab title and favicon will be updated automatically.

### 2. Use the URL Parameters

- You can set the emoji and title on page load by using URL parameters.
- Example: `?emoji=ðŸ˜€&title=New%20Title`
